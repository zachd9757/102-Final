                        My name is Calvin. I'm one of the Programmers at WIP Studios. My area of preference in Computer Science
                        is Computer Systems. My prefrerred programming languages are C, Python, Rust, MATLAB, and Java.
                        Other than programming, I love to tinker with Electronics, Cook, go on hikes, play with my dog Shaun,
                        and play video games.

                        Hey there! I am a junior attending Western Washington 
                        University and pursuing a degree in Computer Science. 
                        Creating things has always been a passion of mine, so 
                        working with my fellow studio members here on neat tools, 
                        apps, games, etc is something of a fulfillment for that 
                        passion. If the whole Computer Science thing didn’t clue 
                        you in, I’m something of a geek and nerd. In my spare 
                        time I like reading and writing fiction, as well as gaming 
                        away the time with my friends. I look forward to working on 
                        all sorts of awesome projects in the future, and my goals 
                        for the future are just that. I want to develop a long line 
                        of beautifully complex things that aren’t just tests of my 
                        ability, but also genuinely create good experiences for 
                        anyone who might use them too.

                        Hello! My name is Kaila Hulse and I am one of the programmers here at Sunflower Studios. I go to Western Washington Universtiy and participate in a variety of activities one being a club
                        called ACM or Association for Computing and Machinery and currently am the Social Media Manager for this club. I mainly enjoy coding in Java but also know a variety of other languages such
                        as Python, C, HTML, and a few others. I would like to pursue a career in Mobile App or Web Development, Full Stack Engineering, or even possibly a career AI related. Outside of school
                        I enjoy Kickboxing, Gaming on my Xbox, Hiking, and Cooking for me and my friends. I am super ecstatic to be working on this project with Sunflower Studios and can't wait to show
                        everyone the results!
