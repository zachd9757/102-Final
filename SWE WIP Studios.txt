Hi There!

My name is Calvin. I'm one of the Programmers at WIP Studios. My area of preference in Computer Science
is Computer Systems. My prefrerred programming languages are C, Python, Rust, MATLAB, and Java.
Other than programming, I love to tinker with Electronics, Cook, go on hikes, play with my dog Shaun,
and play video games.
