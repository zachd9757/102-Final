Hello! My name is Kaila Hulse and I am one of the programmers here at Sunflower Studios. I go to Western Washington Universtiy and participate in a variety of activities one being a club
called ACM or Association for Computing and Machinery and currently am the Social Media Manager for this club. I mainly enjoy coding in Java but also know a variety of other languages such
as Python, C, HTML, and a few others. I would like to pursue a career in Mobile App or Web Development, Full Stack Engineering, or even possibly a career AI related. Outside of school
I enjoy Kickboxing, Gaming on my Xbox, Hiking, and Cooking for me and my friends. I am super ecstatic to be working on this project with Sunflower Studios and can't wait to show
everyone the results!
